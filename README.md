What is it?
-----------

It's a file tagger. It doesn't care what kind of files, it just handles keeping track of their tags.


Why "tigger"?
-------------

Two reasons:

* As a play on the idea of being a tagger, and on "tig", one of the many other names by which the game of [tag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_\(game\)) is known (and the one used where I grew up).
* I will take pretty much any excuse to name a project after an A. A. Milne character.
